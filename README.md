<br>See it in [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duanze.gasst)

I am trying to make it better through the nice OpenSource projects help.

#Lastest Action
Trying to make it can supply EverNote service.But the sdk give me so many "no retern value",asynchronized functions.I am so confused to design a Class for using it.
